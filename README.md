OpenSpace
==

This is a fork of [FreeSpace Open
Source](https://github.com/scp-fs2open/fs2open.github.com) project.

I use it for hacking around the game engine so I have stripped the source code
to the minimum necessary to play the single-player campaign. The following are
gone:

* Windows and Mac-specific code
* Networking and multiplayer code
* Text-to-speech and voice recognition is out
* FRED is out
* CMake builds
* Lua scripting
* Json support

There are no submodules to the project anymore. What you clone is what you
build. It runs fine under Arch.
